# Extra Assignment

In this optional assignment, answer each item with your own words; you can use images, block
diagrams, formulas from other resources if you give their references. Exact copies of definitions from
those resources will not be accepted. Each item is 10 points and 5% of total points you collect from this
assignment will be added to your final grade. This is an INDIVIDUAL project (no TEAM submission
accepted)

For each item, provide at least one paragraph explanation and elaborate your answers with figures,
images, block diagrams and formulas if necessary. In your answers for each item, make sure you
provide the references for the resources you use.


What to Submit [each of these 3 items must be submitted].
1. **Dataset in csv format [for Item 16]**. Submission format: YourName_ExtraAssignment.csv
2. **Jupyter(Ipython [ for Item 16])** Notebook (your code must run without error, otherwise the step
which does not run will not be graded). Submission format: YourName_ExtraAssignment.ipynb
3. **Report in pdf format:** The result (plots, matrix, calculations etc) of each step must be in the report.
You can copy and paste the results of each step into a word file and save as pdf. Or, you can convert
your jupyter notebook (with the code) to pdf as markdown and submit.
Submission format: YourName_ExtraAssignment.pdf
DUE DATE: May 10, 2017 11:50pm
Late Submission will be accepted with 10 points off.
